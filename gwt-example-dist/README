## assumptions

we have a dedicated web server machine. That host is called gruust.stream
in this example. The jetty instance will run as user 'web' on that machine.
We have SSH access to the web account on that machine.

## allow port < 1024 access to regular user on web server machine:

apt-get install authbind
touch /etc/authbind/byport/80 /etfc/authbind/byport/443
chmod 777 /etc/authbind/byport/80 /etfc/authbind/byport/443

## start jetty on server start

Add this to /etc/rc.local (on debian based machines):

    for f in /home/web/*/autostart.sh; do
        su - web -c "$f start"
    done

## deploy update

mvn clean install
mvn antrun:run@go-live -Ddeployment.sshacct=web@gruust.stream

## JDK

The jdk is expected to be installed at /opt/jdk8 on the server. I have
also installed JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) for strong HTTPS support.
