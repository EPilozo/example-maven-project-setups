Want to run embedded jetty server with auto-reload for development. That embedded jetty server should be as close
to the final deployed server as possible, ie. including websockets but without SSL (cert).

Maybe remove webapp stuff entirely.

Work around the issue that GWT dev mode with noserver enabled does not generate .gwt.rpc files needed for GWT-RPC
client-server communication by adding a reverse-proxy servlet for the path '/sandbox' that fetches the generated GWT
stuff from the GWT development server instance. Basically, we want to run GWT noserver mode without telling GWT
about it. I think this is the best, most efficient and most flexible way of working with GWT.
